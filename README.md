# Computer-Vision-and-Aerial-Photography-for-Animal-Detection
A computational research project I completed for my MSci degree in Physics with Theoretical Physics

## Abstract
Knowledge of animal populations is a vital necessity for wildlife conservation. Traditional surveying techniques involving manual labour are ineffective and time-consuming, therefore an innovative method applying a deep learning object detection algorithm to images or videos captured by drone flights was introduced as a solution for automated analysis on large visual datasets. The objective of the project is to design and prototype a methodology derived from this stated idea to study squirrels, a common animal in London. The object detection algorithm YOLO v3 was implemented and a small-scale overhead dataset of squirrels was collected and labelled for retraining the model. Additionally, a live stream of drone video was set up for con- ducting analysis on devices with a high level of computational power. However, the training through transfer learning and the real-time detection on drone videos were not achieved suc- cessfully due to programming difficulties, which can be expected to be resolved by appropriate technical supports and investments.
